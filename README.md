# Reporting Dashboard Lite – ServiceNow

A portfolio project that demonstrates enterprise reporting and dashboarding in ServiceNow
without Performance Analytics (PA). Includes KPI-style reports, executive dashboards,
interactive filters, and scheduled report distribution.

## Objective
Build operational dashboards that help Service Desk and IT leadership monitor:
- Incident volume and priority distribution
- Incident trends (created vs resolved)
- Change workload and status
- Problem trends (including known errors)

## Deliverables
- 6–8 operational reports (Incident/Change/Problem)
- 2 dashboards:
  - Ops Overview (Executive)
  - Service Desk Daily (Team)
- Interactive filters for slicing data (Assignment Group, Priority, Time range)
- Scheduled email “Daily Ops Snapshot” report pack

## Demo (60 seconds)
1. Open **Ops Overview** dashboard → review trends & priority distribution
2. Use **Interactive Filters** to slice by Assignment Group and Priority
3. Open **Service Desk Daily** → validate “my group” view
4. Show **Scheduled Report** email configuration (Daily Ops Snapshot)

## Notes
- Built using Reports + Dashboards + Interactive Filters (no PA access required)
- In PA-enabled environments, these KPIs can be upgraded to PA Indicators
